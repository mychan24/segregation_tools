%
% DESCRIPTION:
%    Calculate versions of system segregation based on system-type (e.g.,
%    average segregation of systems of a certain 'type' to systems of any
%    type, from other systems of the same 'type,' and from systems of all
%    other types).
%    In this venison, the contribution of each 'system' is 
%    proportional to its size (Chan et al. 2021) as oppose to being equal
%    regardless of the system's size (Chan et al. 2014).
%    Three vectors of length T (# of unique system-types) containing
%    different versions of segregation can be output based on the input
%    system-type affiliation vector.
%
% USAGE:
%    [ S_all, S_same, S_other ] = segregation_by_type( M, Ci, Ti );
%
% Inputs: M   :   Weighted symmetrical matrix (n x n matrix)
%                   e.g., fisher-z-transformed correlation matrix.
%
%         Ci  :   Community affiliation vector
%                   e.g., Power labels for Chan et al 441 nodes:
%
%         Ti  :   System-type affiliation vector containing T unique
%                 'types'; a nodes with a system-type label of '0' is
%                 ignored when calculating segregation from communities of
%                 other types (S_other).
%                   e.g., '1' for Sensory-motor, '2' for Association
%
%     (OPTIONAL)
%         diagzero  : Convert diagonal to zero (e.g., if matrix has InF in 
%                     diagonal). Enter 'diagzero'.
%
%         negzero   : Convert negative values to zero. Enter 'negzero'
%
% Outputs: S_all:   for each system-type, the average segregation from all
%                   other communities that have an assigned system-type
%                       e.g., average segregation of association systems to
%                       other association systems and sensory-motor system)
%
%          S_same:  for each system-type, the average segregation from
%                   communities of the same type
%                       e.g., average association-to-association system
%                       segregation.
%
%          S_other: for each system-type, the average segregation from
%                   communities of all other types
%                       e.g., average association-to-sensory-motor system
%                       segregation.
%
%          W_same:  Average of the mean correlation between nodes within the same
%                       community of one system type
%
%          B_all:     Average of edges between nodes from different communities
%                       in all system types 
%
%          B_same:    Average of edges between nodes from different communities
%                       in the same system type
%
%          B_other:   Average of edges between nodes from different communities
%                    	  in the other system type
%                       Note that if there are only two categories of system type, 
%                       the B_other will be the same for both system type.
%
%    Note: Values in output vectors are ordered in ascending order of
%          system-type relative to the input vector Ti.
